### Technology Stack
* React.js
* Next.js
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* Supabase

### Acknowledgements
* The spaced-repetition system used in this application is a lightly modified version of the algorithm used by [Anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki/tree/main), the popular open-source project, which itself uses a modified version of the SuperMemo2 (SM2) algorithm.
